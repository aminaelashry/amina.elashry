Hi! I'm a researcher in the tech industry with interests in particpatory design and innovative applications of powerful tech - i.e. AI, ML. I have experience conducting qualitative, quanitative, and experimental research in both agile enterprise and scientific spaces. I enjoy my work the most when I'm analyzing and understanding human behavior and patterns. I also have interest in the marine science and environmental science and conservation fields, in which case the subject of interest is animal life and ecosystems rather than a "user"/human. My background is in Information Systems/Cybersecurity and Human-Computer Interaction.
